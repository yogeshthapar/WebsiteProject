            <p class="pstat">The World Bank estimates that India is one of the highest ranking countries in the world for the number of children suffering from malnutrition. The prevalence of underweight children in India is among the highest in the world, and is nearly double that of Sub Saharan Africa with dire consequences for mobility, mortality, productivity and economic growth</p>
            <p class ="pstat">Deficiencies in nutrition inflict long-term damage to both individuals and society. Compared with their better-fed peers, nutrition-deficient individuals are more likely to have infectious diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, which lead to a higher mortality rate. In addition, nutrition-deficient individuals are less productive at work.</p>

            <h1 class="hstat">Current situatuion In WorldWide</h1>
            <p class ="pstat">In the developing world, 17% of the population were undernourished during 1997-1999, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).  Astonishingly, this translates into 777.2 million individuals who did not have enough food to meet their daily energy needs.  On the positive side, this is a decline from 816.3 million, or 20% of the population, who were undernourished from 1990-1992. </p>
            <p class="pstat">While there is some good news in these numbers, there is concern about reaching the 1996 World Food Summit’s goal of halving the number of undernourished people in the developing world to approximately 400 million by 2015.  If the decline continues at the current rate of 6 million per year, the goal will not be met.  At this point, the rate would need to increase to 22 million a year to reach the Summit’s goal.  </p>
